# 🔐  Saxo Bank Authentication

This document explains how to authenticate with Saxo Bank API for the WATA application.

## Authentication Process

1. When the application needs to authenticate with Saxo Bank, it will send you a URL via Telegram (or logs of container), that you need to open in your browser.

![Authorization Request](../static/img/ask_authorization.png)

2. Open the provided URL in your web browser.

3. Log in with your Saxo Bank credentials and authorize the application.

4. After authorization, you'll be redirected to a page with a URL containing a `code` parameter. For example:
   ```
   http://localhost/callback?code=abc123def456ghi789&state=abcdef1234567890
   ```

5. Copy the value of the `code` parameter (in this example, `abc123def456ghi789`).

6. On the server where WATA is installed, run the following command:
   ```
   watasaxoauth <CODE>
   ```
   Replace `<CODE>` with the authorization code you copied.

7. The application will now continue with the authentication process using this code to obtain an access token.

```

Authorization code saved successfully! The application will now continue with the authentication process.
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you receive an error about `Failed to obtain new tokens`, you provided an invalid or expired code. Repeat the process to get a fresh authorization code.
- The authorization code is valid only for a short time (typically a few minutes).
- If you see a "Timeout waiting for authorization code" error, it means the application waited for 5 minutes but didn't receive the authorization code.

## Command Reference

- `watasaxoauth <CODE>`: Submits the authorization code to the application
- `watastart`: Starts the application
- `watastop`: Stops the application
- `watalogs`: Shows application logs
- `watastatus`: Shows application status
