# ðŸ”‘  Webhook Token Management

WATA uses token-based authentication to secure webhook endpoints, this token is automatically generated by WATA the first time the web server starts:

1. Each webhook request must include a valid token in the URL (e.g., `/webhook?token=YOUR_TOKEN`)
2. This token is securely generated and stored with strong encryption. (see [App Secret Configuration](configuration#webserver))
3. Manage your webhook token with the `watawebtoken` command

## Command Reference:

- **View your current token**: 
  ```bash
  watawebtoken
  ```

- **Generate a new token**: 
  ```bash
  watawebtoken --new
  ```
  
This will generate a new token and update the persistent storage.

## Security Features:
- All tokens are encrypted before storage
- File permissions are restricted to the owner only
- IP address filtering adds an additional layer of security
